## Welcome to GitHub Pages

  The is a collection of tutorials I did in 2019, it was the best year yet where I got to learn JavaScript and DataScience. Most of the content include dummy ptojects and such dumb things, don't get me wrong but I'm proud I got to learn a lot, and I couldn't get myself to wipe this repo away, a reminder of how far I have come.
