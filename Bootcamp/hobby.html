    <p><strong>Programming</strong></p>
    <p>
      Programming makes me come alive, strengthens me and empowers me to be
      better
    </p>
    <p>
      Programming has made me sit at tables I wouldn't if I didn't know how to
      code
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to at least travel outside the country by the end of the year.
